A personal hobby of mine is using ChatGPT's "custom GPT" feature to develop different GPTs for any random tasks I have in mind.
This repo is a collection of the GPTs I have developed over time. Some of these are from my early days of custom GPT
development, so there will be a few rough versions that do not function exactly how I wanted them to. Others are more recent
and will showcase my improvements in prompting and instruction-writing. All of these GPTs are open to public use and I encourage
all who use them to provide as much feedback as you can.
